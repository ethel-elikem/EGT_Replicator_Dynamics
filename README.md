An Introduction to Evolutionary Game Theory: Replicator Dynamics in 2x2 Symmetric Games
I studied Replicator Dynamics as a model to predict the evolutionary stability of strategies in two-by-two symmetric games for my bachelor's degree thesis in 2020 at the University of Ghana.


### Abstract
In my work, I studied the replicator dynamics. I used the replicator equation, a differential equation-
as a model to predict the evolutionary stability of strategies in symmetric games for a given population.

The populations are assumed to be monomorphic populations, and simulations are run. I discuss the
concept of evolutionary stability first by introducing a definition of evolutionarily stable strategies. I
discuss the relationship between the definition of evolutionarily stable processes and the Nash
Equilibrium from two-player pairwise contests. My study establishes that the concept of an
evolutionarily stable strategy is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium.
Although evolutionarily stable strategies enable us to identify strategies that would
remain stable throughout the evolution of a population, it says nothing about how the population
evolves. More so, when none of the strategies present in the population fit the definition of an
evolutionarily stable strategy, we cannot tell how the population evolves towards stability.
Subsequently, the paper discusses evolutionary stability using game dynamics. Instead of attempting
to define a concept for evolutionarily stable strategies, this approach imitates the dynamics at play in
the given population and studies it using the dynamics of the model. The Replicator Dynamics is the
game dynamic model I use in my study as a tool to model the evolutionary dynamics in a population,
the nature of strategies and their associated payoffs. Using the replicator equation under the replicator
dynamics, I was able to study the evolutionary process for populations playing symmetric games. I run
simulations based on these observations in the fourth chapter of this paper. The paper concludes
by establishing that, although Evolutionarily Stable Strategies may not always exist, the Replicator
Dynamics models the process by which a given population evolves to stability.
